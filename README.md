# base-mvp
App built to showcase basic Android view components like ViewPager, RecyclerView, RateDialog, ProgressDialog, Animation etc.


Inspiration mostly from the good works of Mindorks open source project.

Uses RxJava2, Dagger2, Retrofit2, Room, Butterknife and MVP.
Mostly a replica of the Mindroks app, apart from Retrofit and <Room>.
