# base-mvp
App built to showcase basic Android view components like ViewPager, RecyclerView, RateDialog, ProgressDialog, Animation etc.


Inspiration mostly from the good works of [Mindorks open source project](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/android-mvp-architecture).

Uses RxJava2, Dagger2, Retrofit2, Room, Butterknife and MVP.
Mostly a replica of the Mindroks app, apart from using Retrofit and Room instead of FastAndroidNetworking and GreenDao, for network calls and database operations respectively.
